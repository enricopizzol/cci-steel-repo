[03/20 01:32:17   158s]   The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
[03/20 01:32:17   158s]   A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
[03/20 01:32:17   158s]   Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

[03/20 01:32:23   164s]   The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
[03/20 01:32:23   164s]   A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
[03/20 01:32:23   164s]   Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
