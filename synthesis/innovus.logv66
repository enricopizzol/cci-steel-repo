[03/19 19:51:46   535s] To speed up, if you have to run multiple edit_pin commands then wrap all edit_pin commands within  'setPinAssignMode -pinEditInBatch true' (then edit_pin commands) and 'setPinAssignMode -pinEditInBatch false'
[03/19 19:51:47   536s] Selected [65] pin for spreading. Could not spread (65 out of 65) pins because of constraints on the selected pins or because of some blockage (pin blockage, routing blockage, power stripes etc.) on the selected region.
