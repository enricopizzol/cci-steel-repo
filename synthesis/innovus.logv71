[03/20 01:13:28   170s]   The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
[03/20 01:13:28   170s]   A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
[03/20 01:13:28   170s]   Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.

With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_parallel_arcs'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
